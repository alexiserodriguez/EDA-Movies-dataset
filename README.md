# Exploratory Data Analysis - Movies dataset
In this project, I developed an analysis and visualization from a Movies dataset. The dataset was collected from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/'>Kaggle</a> and cleaned with Pandas Python framework. The main objective from this analysis was to check correlation among a variety of parameters including budget, gross revenue and companies.

You can check the notebook in <a href='https://nbviewer.org/github/alexiserodriguez/EDA-Movies-dataset/blob/main/EDA%20-%20Movies%20dataset%20variables%20correlation.ipynb'>here</a>.
